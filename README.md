# Travel destinations

## Mid-term Team Project for Skill Distillery

### Team members and roles:

* Josh Ingram (Developer, DBA)
* Aspen Newman (Developer, Scrum Master)
* Celicia Slafter (Developer, Repo Owner)

## Overview
This web based application allows travel enthusiasts to discover and share exciting new destinations.  

## Description  
Without logging in, the user is able to browse travel destinations submitted by other users.  Destinations include information such as the address, category(s), features, pictures, official website link, pricing information, and average user rating.  Once logged in (by means of creating their own account), the user is able to create a new travel destination, update their destinations, and delete their destinations.  An in-session user is also able to leave reviews for any destination as well as submit photos, leave comments, and react to other's reviews.  A user's personal profile page shows their account details as well as quick links to view or update their submitted content.   The user can logout to complete their session as well as delete their account.  Users with administrator roles can disable users, reinstate users, and remove user submitted content (destinations, reviews, comments, etc.).
